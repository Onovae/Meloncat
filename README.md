# Meloncat- STUDENTS PERFORMANCE EVALUATION

The PISA2012 dataset Evaluation is a survey of students skills and knowledge as they approach the end of their education. It is not a conventional school test, instead of examining how well students have understood the curriculum, it looks at how prepared they are for life beyond school. Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA2012 assessment for reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally.
